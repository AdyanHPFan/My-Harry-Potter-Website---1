            <p id="HarryStory">There once was a boy named Harry. Destined to be a star. His parents were killed by Voldemort. Who gave him a lightning scar. Yo Harry! You're a wizard!
                Harry goes to Hogwarts, he meets Ron and Hermione
                McGonagall requires he play for Gryffindor
                Draco is a daddy's boy, Quirrell becomes unemployed
                The Sorcerer's Stone is destroyed by Dumbledore
                Ron breaks his wand, now Ginny's gone
                And Harry's in mortal danger
                Tom Riddle hides his snake inside his ginormous secret chamber
                Harry blows up Aunt Marge
                The Dementors come and take charge
                Lupin is a wolf, the rat's a man
                And now the prisoner is at large
                They use time travel, so they can save the prisoner of Azkaban
                Who just so happens to be Harry's Godfather, I don't really get it either
                Harry gets put in the Triwizard Tournament
                With dragons and mermaids, oh no!
                Edward Cullen gets slayed, he's back
                Harry, Harry, It's getting scary
                Voldemort's back and you are a revolutionary Harry
                Dumbledore, Dumbledore
                Why is he ignoring your constant attempts to contact him?
                He is forced to leave the school
                Umbridge arrives, Draco's a tool
                Kids break into the Ministry
                Sirius Black is dead as can be
                Oh
                Split your soul
                Seven parts of a whole
                They're Horcruxes
                It's Dumbledore's end
                There once was a boy named Harry
                Who constantly conquered death
                But in one final duel between good and bad
                He may take his final breath   Link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y57sYHIDP_Y </p>
